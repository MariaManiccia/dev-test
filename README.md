Hello! And thank you for taking the time to review my code. 

On Thursday I was able to work with this project for four hours. I set up the enviroment and started to gather the images and colors of the page.

On Friday I work at night so I was only able to get in two hours of good work. I created the form and the main text box.

On Saturday I had to work at night again, but was able to get more hours in. 4 hours spents matching up the look of the layout and creating the lightbox.

Sunday I worked brunch but then came home and got 3 hours in cleaning up my code and making the page responsive.
